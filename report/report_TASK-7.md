# Implement Client-Side Tool Execution for Location

## Task Description
This task involves implementing client-side execution for the `getLocation` tool in a Next.js chat application. The goal is to avoid unnecessary server round trips by executing the tool directly on the client side and displaying the results in the chat UI.

## Implementation Details
- **`getLocation` Tool Definition**: The `getLocation` tool is defined in the server API route (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) without an `execute` function, indicating that it should be executed on the client side.
- **Client-Side `onToolCall` Handler**: In the client component (`app/page.tsx`), the `useChat` hook is configured with an `onToolCall` handler. This handler checks if the tool being called is `getLocation` and returns a static location (e.g., "San Francisco") for demonstration purposes.
- **Auto-Executing `getLocation`**: The `onToolCall` handler automatically executes the `getLocation` tool when it is called, providing the location data without a server round trip.
- **Displaying Tool Results**: The chat UI is updated to display the results of the `getLocation` tool. If the tool is in the process of being called, a loading message is shown. Once the result is available, the location is displayed.

## Interfaces
- **`getLocation` Tool (Client-Side)**: A tool executed on the client side to get the user's location.
- **`onToolCall` Handler**: A handler in the `useChat` hook that automatically executes tools on the client side.

## Key Decisions
- **Client-Side Execution**: Implementing the `getLocation` tool execution on the client side avoids unnecessary server round trips for simple operations.
  - **Rationale**: Reduces latency and server load for operations that can be handled on the client side.
  - **Implications**: Tool execution logic is moved to the client, which may have security implications if sensitive operations are involved.
- **Using `onToolCall` Hook Option**: Leveraging the `onToolCall` option in the `useChat` hook to handle client-side tool execution.
  - **Rationale**: Utilizes the AI SDK's built-in mechanism for client-side tool handling.
  - **Implications**: Logic is tied to the `useChat` hook API.

## Critical Constraints
- Must implement client-side execution for the `getLocation` tool.
- Ensure correct display of location results in the chat UI.

## Data Structures
- **`toolCall` (onToolCall parameter)**: Provides tool call details to the client-side execution handler.
- **`location` (tool result)**: Stores location information from client-side tool execution.

## Acceptance Testing
- Verify that the `getLocation` tool is auto-executed on the client side when called.
- Ensure that the location information is displayed correctly in the chat UI.
- Confirm that there are no server round trips for the `getLocation` tool execution.
- Check for correct UI states during tool call and result display.
- Ensure no errors in the client-side tool execution flow.

## Conclusion
The task was successfully completed, with the `getLocation` tool being executed on the client side and the results displayed in the chat UI. This approach reduces latency and server load for simple operations, but care must be taken to ensure security for sensitive operations. The implementation demonstrates the benefits and considerations of client-side vs. server-side tool execution strategies.
