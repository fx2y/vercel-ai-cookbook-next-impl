# Implement Tool Calling for Weather Information

## Task Description

This task involved adding a `getWeather` tool to the chat application. The tool fetches weather information for a given city and displays the results in the chat interface.

## Implementation Details

### `getWeather` Tool Definition in `/api/chat/route.ts`

The `getWeather` tool was defined in the server-side route handler. The tool's parameters include the city name and temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The tool returns mock weather data for demonstration purposes.

### Client-Side Handling of Tool Invocations in `app/page.tsx`

The client-side component was modified to handle tool invocations. The `useChat` hook was configured with `maxSteps: 2` to allow one tool call and one response step. The chat UI was updated to display the tool invocation results.

### Displaying Tool Results in Chat UI

The chat UI was updated to check for tool invocations in the messages. If the tool invocation is for `getWeather`, the results are displayed in a formatted manner. If the tool is still being called, a loading message is shown.

## Interfaces

### `getWeather` Tool Interface

- **Description**: Get weather for a location
- **Parameters**:
  - `city`: City name (string)
  - `unit`: Temperature unit (enum: 'C', 'F')
- **Execute**: Async function returning weather data `{ value: number, description: string }`

### Tool Invocation Display

- **Conditional Rendering**: Based on `message.toolInvocations` and `toolInvocation.state`
- **Display**:
  - If `toolInvocation.state === 'result'`, display the result content.
  - If `toolInvocation.state !== 'result'`, display "Checking weather...".

## Key Decisions

- **Static Weather Data**: Simplifies tool implementation for demonstration.
  - **Implications**: Weather data is not real-time; replace with API call for live data.
- **`maxSteps: 2` in `useChat`**: Allows one tool call and one response step.
  - **Implications**: Limits multi-turn tool interactions if more steps are needed.

## Critical Constraints

- Must implement `getWeather` tool.

## Data Structures

### `toolInvocations` (message property)

- **Purpose**: Storing tool call details within chat messages.
- **Format**: `ToolInvocation[]` (from `ai` SDK)

### `weather` (tool result)

- **Purpose**: Representing weather information fetched by tool.
- **Format**: Object: `{ value: number, description: string }`

## Acceptance Testing

- User can trigger `getWeather` tool via chat command.
- Weather information is displayed in chat UI after tool execution.
- Tool parameters (`city`, `unit`) are correctly handled.
- No errors during tool execution or display.
- Code is clean and functional.

## Conclusion

The `getWeather` tool was successfully integrated into the chat application. The tool can be triggered via chat commands, and the weather information is displayed correctly in the chat UI. Future improvements could include replacing the static weather data with real-time data from a weather API.
