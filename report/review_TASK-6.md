The implementation of human-in-the-loop functionality for the `getWeatherInformation` tool is successful. The code quality is acceptable, and the HITL flow works correctly for both confirmation and denial paths. The user experience is clear and functional, and the documentation is adequate. Future improvements could focus on using constants or enums for result states and enhancing the confirmation UI's visual appeal.
