# Implement Human-in-the-Loop for Tool Confirmation

## Task Description

This task involved adding human-in-the-loop (HITL) functionality to the `getWeatherInformation` tool. The goal was to require user confirmation before executing the tool, ensuring that the user has control over the tool's actions.

## Implementation Details

### Modified `getWeatherInformation` Tool

The `getWeatherInformation` tool was modified to remove the `execute` function, indicating that it requires human confirmation before execution.

### `executeWeatherTool` Function

A new function, `executeWeatherTool`, was implemented to provide static weather data. This function is called upon user confirmation.

### Server-side Confirmation Handling

In the server-side route handler (`/api/chat/route.ts`), the following changes were made:
- The `getWeatherInformation` tool definition was modified to remove the `execute` function.
- The `executeWeatherTool` function was implemented separately.
- The POST handler was updated to process the last message parts, check for `tool-invocation` parts, and handle user confirmation or denial.

### Client-side Confirmation UI

In the client-side component (`app/page.tsx`), the following changes were made:
- The message rendering was modified to include a confirmation UI for the `getWeatherInformation` tool.
- If the tool invocation state is `call`, a confirmation message with `Yes` and `No` buttons is displayed.
- The `Yes` button triggers the execution of the `executeWeatherTool` function, while the `No` button returns an error message.

## Interfaces

### `getWeatherInformation` Tool (HITL)
- **Description**: Tool requiring human confirmation before fetching weather info.
- **Signature**: `tool({ description: string, parameters: z.object }) // No execute function`

### `executeWeatherTool` Function
- **Description**: Function to execute weather data retrieval (static data).
- **Signature**: `async ({ city: string }) => Promise<{ value: number, description: string }>`

### Confirmation UI
- **Description**: React UI to prompt user for tool execution confirmation.
- **Signature**: Conditional rendering in `app/page.tsx` based on `toolInvocation.state === 'call'`.

## Key Decisions

1. **Removing `execute` from tool definition for HITL**
   - **Rationale**: Defers tool execution to server-side after user confirmation.
   - **Implications**: Requires client-server round trip for tool execution flow.

2. **Using string-based 'Yes, confirmed.'/'No, denied.' for confirmation results**
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies state management for confirmation flow.
   - **Implications**: Relies on string matching for confirmation handling.

## Critical Constraints
- **Must implement human-in-the-loop for `getWeatherInformation` tool**
  - **Scope**: Tool execution flow.

## Data Structures

### `toolInvocation.state`
- **Purpose**: Tracking tool invocation state (call, result).
- **Format**: String ('call' | 'result').

### `toolInvocation.result`
- **Purpose**: Storing user confirmation or tool execution result.
- **Format**: String ('Yes, confirmed.' | 'No, denied.' | weather result object).

## Acceptance Testing

To verify the HITL flow, the following steps were taken:
1. Initiate a tool invocation for `getWeatherInformation`.
2. Confirm that the confirmation UI is displayed on the client-side.
3. Test both confirmation and denial paths to ensure correct handling and result display.
4. Validate that the server processes the confirmation and executes the tool or returns an error message accordingly.

## Conclusion

The task successfully implemented human-in-the-loop functionality for the `getWeatherInformation` tool. This enhancement ensures that users have control over tool execution, improving the overall user experience. Future steps could involve extending HITL to other tools and refining the user interaction flow for more complex scenarios.
