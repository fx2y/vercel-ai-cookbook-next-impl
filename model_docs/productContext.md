# Product Context

## Purpose
This project is a Next.js application implementing an AI-powered chat interface using the Vercel AI SDK. It serves as a demonstration and implementation of various AI capabilities including text completion, image generation, and specialized tools.

## Problems Solved
1. Provides real-time AI chat interactions with streaming responses
2. Implements tool-based architecture for extensible features
3. Demonstrates human-in-the-loop confirmation system
4. Shows integration of OpenAI's models in a Next.js application
5. Handles complex state management for chat interactions

## How It Works
The application uses a client-server architecture where:
1. Client uses useChat hook for state management and real-time updates
2. Server implements various API routes for different AI functionalities
3. Tools system allows modular addition of new capabilities
4. Human-in-the-loop system ensures user control over critical actions
5. Type safety and validation using TypeScript and Zod throughout
